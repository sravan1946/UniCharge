# QR Code Booking System - Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

I've implemented a complete, secure QR code system for booking verification in your UniCharge app.

### Key Features

1. **Secure QR Token Generation**
   - Tokens include booking ID, timestamp, and cryptographic signature
   - Tokens expire after 24 hours
   - Format: `bookingId:timestamp:signature`

2. **Booking Confirmation Screen**
   - Displayed automatically after booking creation
   - Shows large, scannable QR code
   - Displays booking summary and instructions
   - User can present QR code to admin at station

3. **Admin QR Scanner**
   - Accessible from Profile screen → "Admin Access" section
   - Full-screen camera scanner with overlay
   - Real-time QR code detection
   - Automatic booking activation on successful scan

4. **Security Features**
   - Only admin scanning can activate bookings
   - Token verification prevents tampering
   - Expiration prevents reuse of old bookings
   - Status validation ensures proper workflow

### Files Added/Modified

#### New Files
1. `lib/services/qr_token_service.dart` - Token generation and verification
2. `lib/features/bookings/screens/booking_confirmation_screen.dart` - QR code display
3. `lib/features/admin/screens/qr_scanner_screen.dart` - Admin scanning interface
4. `docs/qr_code_system.md` - Complete documentation

#### Modified Files
1. `pubspec.yaml` - Added dependencies:
   - `qr_flutter: ^4.1.0` - QR code generation
   - `mobile_scanner: ^7.1.3` - QR code scanning
   - `crypto: ^3.0.5` - Security hashing

2. `lib/models/booking_model.dart` - Added `qrToken` field
3. `lib/services/firestore_database_service.dart` - Added:
   - `getBookingById()` method
   - QR token generation in `createBooking()`
   - QR token handling in all booking methods

4. `lib/features/stations/screens/station_details_screen.dart` - Navigates to confirmation screen after booking
5. `lib/features/profile/screens/profile_screen.dart` - Added admin access button

### How It Works

#### User Flow
1. User creates a booking from station details screen
2. Booking is created with status 'reserved' and QR token is generated
3. Booking confirmation screen is displayed with QR code
4. User shows QR code to admin at the station
5. Admin scans the QR code using the admin scanner
6. System validates the token and activates the booking
7. Booking status changes: 'reserved' → 'active'
8. Slot status changes: 'reserved' → 'occupied'
9. User can now use the slot

#### Security Measures
- **Token format**: Contains booking ID, timestamp, and cryptographic signature
- **Expiration**: Tokens expire after 24 hours
- **Verification**: Multiple validation steps before activation
- **Admin-only activation**: Only admin scanning can mark slot as occupied
- **Status validation**: Ensures booking is in correct state before activation

### Admin Access

Admins can access the QR scanner from:
```
Profile Screen → "Admin Access" section → "Scan Booking QR Code" button
```

### Key Benefits

1. **Security**: Only authorized admins can activate bookings
2. **User-friendly**: Simple QR code display for users
3. **Verified**: Tokens are cryptographically signed to prevent tampering
4. **Time-limited**: Prevents reuse of old bookings
5. **Clear workflow**: Status progression ensures proper booking lifecycle

### Testing the System

To test:
1. Create a booking from any station
2. View the QR code on the confirmation screen
3. Open Profile screen
4. Click "Scan Booking QR Code" in Admin Access section
5. Scan the QR code from your confirmation screen
6. Verify booking activates successfully

### Database Changes

The `bookings` collection now includes a `qrToken` field:
```json
{
  "id": "booking123",
  "userId": "user456",
  "status": "reserved",
  "qrToken": "booking123:1234567890:signature",
  ...
}
```

### Next Steps

The system is ready to use! You may want to:
1. Add role-based access control for admin features
2. Implement user role management
3. Add booking history with archived QR codes
4. Create admin dashboard for booking analytics
5. Add push notifications on booking activation

### Notes

- QR codes expire after 24 hours
- Tokens are generated server-side for security
- Admin scanner includes comprehensive error handling
- All validation happens on the app side for immediate feedback
