# Quick Start - ParkCharge

## ✅ Pre-Flight Checklist

Everything is ready! Your app is configured and error-free.

### What's Ready:
- ✅ Flutter dependencies installed
- ✅ Code analysis passing (no errors)
- ✅ Environment file (.env) exists
- ✅ Generated model files present
- ✅ App configuration complete

### What You Need to Verify:
1. **Appwrite Backend** - Your `.env` file should have valid Appwrite credentials
2. **Google Maps API Key** - Required for map features (if using maps)

## 🚀 Run the App

### Option 1: Run on Android Emulator/Device
```bash
flutter run
```

### Option 2: Run on Chrome (Web)
```bash
flutter run -d chrome
```

### Option 3: See Available Devices
```bash
flutter devices
```

## 📱 First Time Setup

When you run the app for the first time:

1. **Login Screen** will appear
2. **Create Account** or use existing credentials
3. The app will connect to your Appwrite backend

## ⚠️ Optional: Missing Assets

If you see font or asset warnings (not critical):
- **Fonts**: Download Inter fonts or remove font config from `pubspec.yaml`
- **Images**: Place placeholder images in `assets/images/`
- **Animations**: Add Rive files to `assets/animations/`

These are optional and won't prevent the app from running.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### App crashes on startup:
```bash
# Clean and rebuild
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

### Environment variables not loading:
- Check that `.env` file exists in project root
- Verify it's not accidentally ignored by `.gitignore`

### Need to regenerate code:
```bash
flutter packages pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```
