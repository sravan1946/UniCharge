# ✅ ParkCharge MVP - All Todos Completed!

## 🎉 Implementation Status: 100% Complete

All todos from the ParkCharge MVP implementation plan have been successfully completed:

### ✅ **Project Setup & Configuration**
- [x] Initialize Flutter project with web support, configure pubspec.yaml with all dependencies (Riverpod, Appwrite, Google Maps, Rive, etc.), and set up environment configuration
- [x] Create Appwrite client configuration, define constants for database/collection IDs, and set up environment variables

### ✅ **Data Models & Services**
- [x] Create Dart models for Station, Slot, Booking, and UserProfile matching Appwrite schema with JSON serialization
- [x] Implement service layer: Auth service (login/signup), Database service (CRUD operations), and Realtime service (subscriptions)

### ✅ **State Management & Navigation**
- [x] Set up Riverpod providers for auth, location, stations, bookings, and realtime state management
- [x] Create app theme (light/dark mode) with color scheme and set up GoRouter navigation with route guards

### ✅ **Core Features**
- [x] Build home screen with Google Maps integration, station markers, nearby stations list, and search/filter functionality
- [x] Create station detail screen with custom slot grid UI (theater-seat layout), real-time slot updates, and slot selection logic
- [x] Create Rive animations for charging progress and battery swap, implement Rive widget wrappers with state bindings
- [x] Implement booking flow: confirmation screen, active booking view with charging progress, booking history, and cancel logic
- [x] Build user profile screen with statistics, settings (dark mode toggle), and logout functionality

### ✅ **Real-time Integration**
- [x] Wire up Appwrite Realtime subscriptions in providers to enable live slot status updates across the app

### ✅ **Web Dashboard & Simulation**
- [x] Build Flutter Web simulation dashboard with station controls, slot manipulation panel, analytics display, and auto-simulation features
- [x] Create Python simulation script with Appwrite SDK integration, multiple modes (random/realistic), and battery swap simulation
- [x] Build Python script to populate Appwrite with sample stations and slots for demo purposes

### ✅ **Documentation & Polish**
- [x] Write comprehensive README, Appwrite setup guide, and demo guide with instructions for running the complete system
- [x] Add error handling, loading states, empty states, haptic feedback, and test critical flows (auth, booking, realtime)
